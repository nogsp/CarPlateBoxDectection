# Car Plate Box Dectection
Project developed for the discipline of Signais and systems at UFPE, 

## Main depedencias:
  -   numpy
  -   openCV
  -   easyocr
  -   pytorch
  -   imutils
  -   glob
 
- Tested using Anaconda Environment with Python 3.8.5
 
## Running the PlateBox Detect:
Run the code ```plateBoxDetect.py ``` for find car plate Box with fourier transform in images dataset located in images/*, for more details of the operation see the report.
## Running the Basic openCV implementation:
Run the code ```openCVDetect.py ``` for find car plate Box with openCV Canny Edge Detection algoritms in images dataset located in images/*,  for more details of the operation see the report.
